# OpenOmni

This repository contains all the discovered protocols, commands, error types and other messages used to communicate with an Omnipod pump described in the [wiki](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki) together with many [Packet Captures](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Packet-Captures) which have been used to find the logic behind each command.

Also provided are the 2 programs used for decoding the Omnipod communications for RTLSDR and RFCAT devices.

## Current Status

- In 2016 we figured out the [RF modulation](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/RF-Modulation) and [packet/message encoding](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki). (1 year)
- In 2017 we got the firmware from the Pod chip, reverse engineering,  decoding the meaning of the bytes in the body for each of the [Message Types](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Message-Types). (2 years)
- In 2018 implementation of the commands and logic started first within the [Rileylink_ios Omnikit](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink_ios/tree/omnipod-testing) framework for using the pump with [Loop](https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop/tree/omnipod-testing) and [Rileylink](https://getrileylink.org/) hardware. (1 year) 
- In 2018 the [porting of Rileylink_ios to RileyLinkAAPS](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS/tree/dev_medtronic) was started for the Medtronic Pump to be able to use it with [AndroidAPS](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS) (1 year in the works, see current progress [here](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS/projects/1))
- In February 2019 [Omnipy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy) was released to the public, an implementation that allows looping with the omnipod by using the omnipy program to communicate with AndroidAPS
- A [port of Rileylink_ios Omnipod](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS/tree/dev_omnipod) to RileyLinkAAPS was started but needs people with Java/Android experience.
- On 23rd April 2019 the first test/dev version of [DIY Loop for Omnipod](https://github.com/loopKit/loop/tree/omnipod-testing) was publicly released.
- In 2019 the new bluetooth powered Omnipod Dash will be implemented in [Tidepool Loop](https://github.com/tidepool-org/Loop)

## What you'll need to capture the commands

There  are 2 ways you can build a radio capture and parsing setup:

1. RFCAT Omni

This was the first python based capture program, which parsed the data as raw or as txt.
This needs a [compatible RF Cat USB stick](https://int3.cc/products/rfcat) and has done a great job in capturing, but was expensive because you will need to flash firmware onto it using a [CC-Debugger](https://store.ti.com/CC-DEBUGGER-Debugger-and-Programmer-for-RF-System-on-Chips-P1627.aspx) and we later discovered it was missing some packages.

2. RTL-SDR Omni

This program was later developped to capture the pure wav files in C which can parsed directly. It can also parse the raw txt data of the RFCAT above. This solution uses an [inexpensive RTL-SDR USB stick with an antenna](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles) (really needed to get a good recording) as cheaper hardware solution.
